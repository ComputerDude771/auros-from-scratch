# tools — proofs, not demos

Each of these exists because a change here was too easy to get subtly
wrong to accept on inspection alone. They are meant to be run, and they
exit non-zero when they fail.

| | What it proves |
|---|---|
| `recip_proof.c` | The blur's multiply-and-shift replacement for integer division is **exact** — checked over every (window, sum) pair a blur can produce, all 4.2 million of them, for radius 1..128. Not a spot check. |
| `blur_equiv.c` | The rewritten blur matches the one it replaced pixel for pixel, on adversarial full-contrast noise across 9 radii × 8 region shapes including off-screen, 1×1 and 1-pixel-wide slivers. Also times both. |
| `hittest.c` | Every archetype hit-tests where it paints, at 1024×600, 1366×768, 1920×1080 and 2560×1440. Sweeps `click()` across the screen and checks each consumed click against a mask of what was actually drawn. |

```sh
cc -O2 -o /tmp/recip_proof tools/recip_proof.c && /tmp/recip_proof
cc -O2 -std=gnu11 -o /tmp/blur_equiv tools/blur_equiv.c src/aurshell/draw.c -lm && /tmp/blur_equiv
cc -O2 -std=gnu11 -o /tmp/hittest tools/hittest.c src/aurshell/draw.c \
   src/aurshell/shellcommon.c src/aurshell/anim.c src/aurshell/layouts/*.c \
   src/common/theme.c src/common/font.c -lm && /tmp/hittest
```

`blur_equiv` carries a verbatim copy of the *old* implementation, so it
keeps working as a reference after the original is gone from the tree.
It tolerates a difference of at most 2/255 per channel, which is what
reordering the separable passes costs in intermediate rounding; on real
frames the observed maximum is 1/255 on under 0.5% of subpixels.

`hittest` exists because `rail` painted with the surface's size and
hit-tested against a hardcoded 1600×900, so on the 1366×768 panels this
product targets, the default desktop's clicks landed in the wrong place.
The first version of the test compared the *shape* of the clickable
region across resolutions and passed with the bug still in — a region
clipped by the screen edge changes size even when the geometry behind it
is constant. Comparing clicks against painted pixels catches it at every
resolution. Checked by putting the bug back: 0.7–7.9% of clicks land on
bare wallpaper, against 0.0% when it is fixed.
